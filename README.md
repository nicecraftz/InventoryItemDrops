# InventoryItemDrops

InventoryItemDrops is a lightweight Paper plugin designed for Prison-style or performance-focused Minecraft servers. It eliminates the need for dropped items on the ground, helping reduce lag and clutter.

When enabled, ores are automatically smelted and placed directly into the player’s inventory instead of dropping on the ground. Behavior and features can be customized through the configuration file.
